## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
library("pacman")
```

# Already installed Tidyverse to upload csv file from my laptop.
# I will load the package now. 

```{r}
library("tidyverse")
```

# Upload my csv file.

```{r}
Star <- read.csv("Star.csv")
```

# Use the summary function to gain an overview of the data set.

```{r}
summary(Star)
```
# Display the first couple of rows to observe. 

```{r}
data(Star)
head(Star)
```
# Display the mean and median for at least 2 attributes.

# Mean and Median for tmatssk.

```{r}
mean(Star$tmathssk)
```
```{r}
median(Star$tmathssk)
```
# Mean and Median for treadssk.

```{r}
mean(Star$treadssk)
```
```{r}
median(Star$treadssk)
```
# Create a new data frame with a subset of the columns and rows. Make sure to rename it. 

# Display columns X, tmathssk, treadssk, classk, sex, race.

# Display tmathssk and treadssk greater than or equal to 500.

```{r}
df.star <- data.frame(Star)
substar <- df.star[df.star$tmathssk >= 500 & df.star$treadssk >= 500, c("X", "tmathssk", "treadssk", "classk", "sex", "race")]
substar
```
# Create new column names for the new data frame.

# Display Column Names.

```{r}
colnames(substar)
```
```{r}
colnames(substar)[1:6] = c("STUDENT ID", "MATH SCORE", "READING SCORE", "CLASS TYPE", "GENDER", "RACE")
head(substar)
```
# Use the summary function to create an overview of your new data frame. Then print the mean and median for the same two attributes. Please compare.

```{r}
summary(substar)
```

# Display the mean and median for the same two attributes. Please compare.

# Mean and Median for Math Score.

# My conclustion on my comparison below removing the scores below 500 had increased the average and the median in substar. 

```{r}
mean(substar$'MATH SCORE') 

# The average in MATH SCORE in substar dataframe is more than the average in tmathssk in Star dataframe.  
```
```{r}
median(substar$`MATH SCORE`)

# The median in MATH SCORE in substar dataframe is more than the average in tmathssk in Star dataframe. 
```
# Mean and Median for READING SCORE.

```{r}
mean(substar$`READING SCORE`)

# The average in READING SCORE in substar dataframe is more than the average in treadssk in Star dataframe. 
```
```{r}
median(substar$`READING SCORE`)

# The in median READING SCORE in substar dataframe is more than the median in treadssk in Star dataframe. 
```
# For at least 3 values in a column please rename so that every value in that column is renamed. (Did 8.)

```{r}
substar[substar == "boy"] <- "Male"
substar[substar == "girl"] <- "Female"
substar[substar == "regular"] <- "Regular Class"
substar[substar == "regular.with.aide"] <- "Regular Class With Aide"

substar[substar == "white"] <- "White"
substar[substar == "black"] <- "Black"

rownames(substar) <- 1:nrow(substar)
substar
```
# Display enough rows to see examples of all of steps 1-5 above.

```{r}
head(substar,10)
```
# BONUS â€“ place the original .csv in a github file and have R read from the link.

```{r}
theUrl <- "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/enidroman/R-Programing/main/Star.csv"
bsubstar <- read.table(file=theUrl, header=TRUE, sep=",")
